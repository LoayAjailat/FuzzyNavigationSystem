# Robotics - Fuzzy Logic System

## Aims & Objectives
The project aims to design a Fuzzy logic system capable of driving the Pioneer 3-DX intelligent mobile robot using the ARIA API. The robot's objectives are (in order of importance):
  1. Follow a right-edge wall (using sonar sensors on the right-hand side)
  2. Avoid any obstacles presented within the robot's FOV (using sonar sensors on the front)
  3. If no wall is detected on the right-side and no obstacles are present, then the robot would seek a right-edge wall (Goal seeking).
  
## Requirements
  - ARIA Python API
